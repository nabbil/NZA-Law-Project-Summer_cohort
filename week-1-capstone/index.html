  Ashley S. Portman recently recovered over $400,000 for our client.</h3>
  <P style="color: white">
  in an employee theft fidelity case from a third-party accused of stealing from its employer, the insured. The recovery
  was obtained without the need to file a civil suit due to a detailed inquiry into the third-party’s assets and an
  assessment of the policy provisions between the insurer and its insured.</P>
  
  <h3 style="color: white">
  Paul Bozych and Preetha Jayakumar won motions to dismiss (TCPA).</h3>

  <p style="color: white">The rulings reflect a significant departure from the Seventh Circuit case law concerning alleged TCPA statutory
  violations and Article III standing. In both suits, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants violated the TCPA by
  sending unsolicited facsimile advertisements that do not comply with the TCPA’s opt-out notice requirements. The TCPA
  permits a recipient of such fax advertisements to bring legal action against the sender and recover either actual
  damages or statutory damages up to $1500 per violation. The 7th Circuit courts have generally held that receipt of
  unsolicited fax advertisement with an imperfect opt-out notice is sufficient to confer an Article III injury. However,
  the recent rulings clarified that the receipt of such a fax absent a de facto injury is insufficient as a matter of law
  to establish Article III standing under the Supreme Court’s holding in Spokeo v. Robins, 136 S. C.t. 1540 (2016).</p>
